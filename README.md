# CSS Reset

### Why we need to reset css?
1. Cross-Browser Consistency:
Different browsers have their own default styles for HTML elements. For instance, the margin, padding, font size, and other properties for elements like \<h1>, \<p>, \<ul>, etc., can vary significantly between browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari).

2. Normalize Default Styles:
A CSS reset helps normalize the appearance of all HTML elements by removing the default browser styles. This "blank slate" allows you to define your own styles from scratch, ensuring greater control over how your site looks and behaves.

3. Foundation for Custom Styles:
Starting with a reset makes it easier to build and maintain your custom styles, knowing that there are no hidden or unexpected default styles that could cause issues down the line.
